# Welcome to Module 1

Writing code is a definitely a core part of what developers do. There are,
however, many other related skills and tasks we need to take care of. Before we
dive into object-orientated programming, we need to cover a few topics related
to programming in general.

This section contains a set of lessons to help get you set up for this course.
Topics include:

* Setting up your local environment
* A review of git concepts
* A review of hashketball for lecture
* The programmer's mindset

Learning how to program is more than just that knowing how to code. The rest is
knowing how to learn, how to ask questions, how to communicate with your peers,
how to find resources, and how to solve problems.
