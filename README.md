# Welcome to Module 1

Hello and welcome to Module 1 of the Software Engineering Immersive! In this first
part of the course, we will introduce you to a variety of concepts, starting
with object-orientation in Ruby. Then, we'll introduce databases and incorporate
them into our Ruby code, retrieve data from remote sources, and finish by building
a project to bring everything together.

However, writing code is a small part of what developers do. This section contains
a variety of lessons specific to your first day in the immersive course. Topics
include:

* Setting up your local environment
* Your first group project
* A review of hashketball for lecture
* A review of git concepts
* The programmer mindset
* Naming your cohort

Remember, learning how to program is more than just that knowing how to code.
The rest is knowing how to learn, how to ask questions, how to communicate with
your peers, how to find resources, and how to solve problems.
