# Welcome to Module 1

Writing code is a core part of what developers do. There are, however, many
other related skills and tasks we need to learn about and take care of. These
skills include knowing how to setup and navigate your own computer's
environment. They also include knowing how to navigate your _real-world_
environment - collaborate and communicate with your peers. Both are important
for setting yourself up for success.

This section contains a set of lessons to help get you set up both environments
for this course. Topics include:

* Setting up your local environment
* A review of git concepts
* A review of hashketball for lecture
* The programmer's mindset
* Your cohort's name

Learning how to program is more than just that knowing how to code. The rest is
knowing how to learn, how to ask questions, how to communicate with your peers,
how to find resources, and how to solve problems.
